## How This Project Started

My high school, Gwangyang Jecheol High School, allowed students to organize meal plans, so they could choose when they wanted to eat. While this was nice for not wasting money by not signing up for meals they didn't need, it was often difficult for students to remember the date they signed up. The meal plan website was too slow and bad to check their meal plan status in front of the cafeteria gate.

It seemed obvious that this was an uncomfortable situation. The first goal was simple: building a website showing today's cafeteria menu and their meal plan status.

I asked some friends of mine to use my first demo for a week. One of them suggested to me that I turned this website into an app since most of Koreans were more familiar to using apps than websites. I wanted to create this service on the web, so I chose a web app as a compromise.

So, I created the web app 'zego.life' and added school life information to the app in addition to the meal plan function, and it became loved by many students.
